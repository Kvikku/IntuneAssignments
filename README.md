# Intune Assignments

# Overview

This application aims to solve one big issue I've had with Microsoft Intune for a long time - how to efficiently deploy a large amount of applications and profiles/policies to one or more groups with just a few clicks.

Usually this process involves a lot of manual work and mouse clicks, which in turn increases the probability for human error.


__With this application you can now effectively deploy a large number of applications and policies to multiple groups in seconds. There are also additional functionality available, such as updating the description property of all objects, and deleting assignments in bulk__


And before you ask - No, we don't talk about policy sets in Intune. Policy sets is missing a lot of features and is quite buggy, in my honest opinion.


__NOTE - This application is a work in progress. Errors, crashes and unexpected behaviour can occur__
