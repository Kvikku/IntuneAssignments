# Intune Assignments

# Overview

This application aims to solve one big issue I've had with Microsoft Intune for a long time - how to efficiently deploy a large amount of applications and profiles/policies to one or more groups with just a few clicks.

Usually this process involves a lot of manual work and mouse clicks, which in turn increases the probability for human error.


__With this application you can now effectively deploy a large number of applications and policies to multiple groups in seconds. There are also additional functionality available, such as updating the description property of all objects, and deleting assignments in bulk__

With this app you can:

1. Deploy a large amount of groups to a large amount of profiles and applications effectively
2. Delete assignment for a large amount of groups to a large amount of profiles and applications effectively
3. Update the description property of a large amount of profiles and applications effectively

And before you ask - No, we don't talk about policy sets in Intune. Policy sets is missing a lot of features and is quite buggy, in my honest opinion.

You will also be able to copy content from a template tenant to a new tenant!


__NOTE - This application is a work in progress. Errors, crashes and unexpected behaviour can occur__


# Getting started

Please read the Wiki (https://github.com/Kvikku/IntuneAssignments/wiki) for help with the pre-reqs and how to use the app!

An installer is now provided to help install all necessary dependencies and the application itself. 


# New releases!

The ability to copy content from a template tenant to a destination tenant is coming in the next release!

Filters have been added as an assignment option!

Since version 0.2.0-beta, user based authentication is now the standard, and client secret authentication has been removed. If you are coming from an earlier version of the app you must adjust to this change :)
