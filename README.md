# Intune Assignments

# Overview

This application aims to solve one big issue I've had with Microsoft Intune for a long time - how to efficiently deploy a large amount of applications and profiles/policies to one or more groups with just a few clicks.

Usually with process involves a lot of manual work and mouse clicks, which in turn increases the probability for human error.

And before you ask - No, we don't talk about policy sets in Intune to solve this. Shh!

# About the author

I am a system administrator working primarly with Microsoft 365 services, such as Microsoft Intune and Microsoft 365 Defender.

I am entirely self taught with no formal education within software development. As such, the experienced developers among you will probably discover ineffecient, subpar and non optimized code. Feel free to provide constructive criticism and feedback.
